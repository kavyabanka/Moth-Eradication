# Moth-Eradication <br>
This repository aims to provide effective solutions for controlling moth populations and preventing infestations using Python-based techniques. Check out the repository for more details.<br>
## Problem Statement <br>
The task is to determine the minimum length of the perimeter of the polygon which encloses all the traps within it. This listingâ€™s starting point is not important, but it must be clockwise and start and end at the same location <br>
## What we learned from the project?? <br>
We learned about the fundamental computational geometry problem known as the **convex-hull problem** and used the **gift-wrapping** approach to solve it.<br>
To know the project in a more detailed way, please look into the **MOTH ERADICATION** pdf in the repository.<br>
Feel Free to contribute to the code.<br>
Thank You.
